Next Steps:

Check If loadTasks() is Dispatching

In your component where you load tasks (e.g., Tasks.js), add a console log in useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Dispatching loadTasks...");
  dispatch(loadTasks());
}, [dispatch]);


Open the browser console (F12 → Console Tab) and check if you see "Dispatching loadTasks...".

If you do not see it, the useEffect isn't triggering. Check if the component is mounted correctly.


Check If Redux Store Gets the Data

Modify getTasks in taskSlice.js:

getTasks: (state, action) => {
  console.log("Tasks received from API:", action.payload); // Debugging
  state.tasks = action.payload.tasks; // Update state
  state.loading = false;
},

- Expected console output:

Tasks received from API: {tasks: [{id: 1, task: "...", completed: true}, {...}]}

- If action.payload.tasks is undefined, update it to:

state.tasks = action.payload; // If API returns an array directly

Check If Redux Store Actually Holds Tasks

Open Redux DevTools in Chrome:

- Right-click the page → Inspect → Redux tab (Install Redux DevTools extension if missing).

- Look at the tasks slice in the state.

- If it's [] (empty), something is breaking in the middleware or dispatch process.

Ensure the UI is Reading the Redux State

In the component where tasks should be displayed, check if you're correctly selecting the state:

const tasks = useSelector((state) => state.tasks.tasks);
console.log("Tasks in UI:", tasks);

- If tasks is undefined or [], Redux isn't updating properly.
- If tasks contains the correct array but isn't rendering, check your UI logic.

Summary:

1. Backend is working.

2. Check if loadTasks() is firing (Step 1).

3. Check if Redux is receiving the data (Step 2, Step 3).

4. Check if UI is reading the Redux state (Step 4).
